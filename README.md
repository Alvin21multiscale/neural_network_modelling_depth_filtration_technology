# neural_network_modelling_depth_filtration_technology
Contains the python code for creating the fully-connected neural network model to model the pre-treatment depth filtration process in my current PhD research.

DNN_3.py is the python which creates a fully-connected neural network to model the energy loss of pre-treatment depth filtration process deployed in desalination facilities. 

Sample .csv file is attached to be read by the code.
